# LLManga

Use OCR and LLMs together to try and grasp the meaning of Japanese in printed media (Manga, Illustrations, Games, etc)

This project will capture efforts to explore the intersection between manga, OCR, and LLMs, operating in concert to allow individuals with less-than-fluent proficiency in Japanese to make printed Japanese media more accessable to them. 

LLManga aims to be a pluggable tool which can utilize different OCR and LLM services, configured by an end user, in order to: 

* Quickly capture Japanese text present in digital images
* Interpret their meaning using AI-generated machine translations 
* Create flash-cards to aid in remembering and memorizing vocabulary
